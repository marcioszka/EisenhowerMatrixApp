## Introduction

The Eisenhower Matrix is a decision-making framework that categorizes tasks into four quadrants:

- **Quadrant I (Important & Urgent)**: Tasks that require immediate attention. These are your top priorities.

- **Quadrant II (Important & Not Urgent)**: Tasks that are important but not time-sensitive. These tasks should be planned and scheduled for the future.

- **Quadrant III (Not Important & Urgent)**: Tasks that are urgent but not essential. Delegate or minimize the time spent on these tasks.

- **Quadrant IV (Not Important & Not Urgent)**: Tasks that are neither urgent nor important. These tasks are distractions and should be avoided or minimized.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and organize tasks into the four quadrants of the Eisenhower Matrix. Mark/unmark as done or remove from TODOs.

- **Deadline Tracking**: Set due dates and deadlines for tasks to manage urgency effectively.

- **Archivization**: Automatically archive all done tasks before quit the application.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive user interface for seamless task management.
